# 🧪 E-Commerce Website Automation Testing

This repository showcases my practical work in **automating e-commerce website testing** using **Selenium WebDriver**, **TestNG**, and **Java**.  
The framework follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern for scalability, maintainability, and efficient test execution.
